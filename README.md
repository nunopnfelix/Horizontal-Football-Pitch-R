# Horizontal-Football-Pitch-R
⚽ Horizontal Football Pitch in R ⚽

Simple Layout of a horizontal football pitch. In my case, i use a variation of this ggpplot in my website (TheStatsWay) for the presentation of a TOTW (Team of the Year) or TOTS (Team of the Season) with player numbers or player ratings + team shirt color.

## Example:
